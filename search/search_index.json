The Razor client, currently under development, lacks many of the needed features. Thus, support for CUO/Razor is a \"best effort\"; development is closely monitored and new scripts will be added when they provide new versions. My preference will always be UOSteam, at least for now. So you might see 3-4 versions of a script for UOSteam, and only 1 for CUO/Razor. I am just hesitant to put a lot of time into CUO/Razor right now since its actively being developed and might change. As 2021 progresses, I expect this to slowly reverse - as it gets updated for player script needs. Since this is a curated collection of scripts, there won't be many at first. I am combing through everything available for the clients, and slowly adding them. Since each has to be edited and tested, this is a slow process. Your patience is appreciated.

I joined UO Outlands in December 2020 - yes, I am that new! I don't even have a house yet! Like most players new to the server, I started looking for scripts and found several github repositories forked over and over, many in a state of limbo and certainly not maintained. Being an avid fan of Ultima Online, an experienced UOSteam scripter, and a professional programmer, I decided to start my own repository. I am a scripting enthusiast and, like you, always learning how to do things better. If you see anything that needs improvement or have ideas, please send them along. goals I am combing through all the UOO scripting \"fork and forget\" github repositories available, then audit, test, publish the new versions. Since the Razor client is now supporting more commands, when possible, I will also provide Razor versions of these scripts. After doing this for a few years, I have realized there is no script that will fit everyone 100%. Therefore, I try to provide versions that most people can use. Feel free to further customize to fit your needs. Much of my work is intended to teach you how to do something, and be a template for customization. markdown All my my work will be in markdown, served to you as a web page. This not only provides a better user experience, but discourages the \"fork and forget\" behavior I have seen in github around these scripts, where people just copy a repository for their own use and not maintain it. attribution Attribution with these scripts is difficult, since most people just copy-paste snippets they find somewhere else, and the \"true author\" has probably been lost. For this reason, I do not claim to be the original author of every line of code. I will claim, however, to have audited and tested every script. You do not need to give me any attribution for scripts contained herein - please use them as you see fit and enjoy. If you send me a script, please include your name so I can at least give credit where it is due. razor support If you are using these scripts in Razor, they have been written and tested for the UOO Classic UO client only. contact You can send me a private message at Xotl in the UO Outlands Discord server. I always appreciate requests, support, and jokes.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#goals","text":"I am combing through all the UOO scripting \"fork and forget\" github repositories available, then audit, test, publish the new versions.

The drawback with this method is you must get at least 50 Veterinary and buy a pack horse. A lot of characters have 50 spare points in their builds, making this a viable option. In order to train healing, you will need a magical wizards hat in your pack. This is a trick to lower your own health bar temporarily so you can bandage. Most folks want to train healing alongside melee, so I have included it in this version. We can take advantage of the UO Steam diffhits capability to seldom heal the pony, while concentrating heals on your character. You will see this code below, where it prioritizes raising your healing skill and only helping the pony when its required. You can diffhits a pet, you cannot use it on another character, making it optimal for this use case. To put the proverbial cherry on top of this script, it uses your bank to pull bandages from a container. You can literally run this for days.

The drawback with this method is you must get at least 50 Veterinary and buy a pack horse. A lot of characters have 50 spare points in their builds, making this a viable option. In order to train healing, you will need a magical wizards hat in your pack. This is a trick to lower your own health bar temporarily so you can bandage. Most folks want to train healing alongside melee, so I have included it in this version. We can take advantage of the UO Steam diffhits capability to seldom heal the pony, while concentrating heals on your character. You will see this code below, where it prioritizes raising your healing skill and only helping the pony when its required. You can diffhits a pet, you cannot use it on another character, making it optimal for this use case. To put the proverbial cherry on top of this script, it uses your bank to pull bandages from a container. You can literally run this for days.
