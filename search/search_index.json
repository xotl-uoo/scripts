I joined UO Outlands in December 2020 - yes, I am that new! I don't even have a house yet! Like most players new to the server, I started looking for scripts and found several github repositories forked over and over, many in a state of limbo and certainly not maintained. Being an avid fan of Ultima Online, an experienced UOSteam scripter, and a professional programmer, I decided to start my own repository. I am a scripting enthusiast and, like you, always learning how to do things better. If you see anything that needs improvement or have ideas, please send them along. Goals update I am combing through all abandoned github repositories available, then audit, test, publish the new versions. Since the Razor client is now supporting more commands, when possible, I will also provide Razor versions of these scripts. streamline After doing this for a few years, I have realized there is no script that will fit everyone 100%. Therefore, I try to provide versions that most people can use. Feel free to further customize to fit your needs. Much of my work is intended to teach you how to do something, and be a template for customization. test Testing is huge , and every script I post will have been tested by me. To help re-testing efforts, as server code can break a script, I record the test dates with each script. Then, after a few months, I can revisit them. easier copying Typical scripts in github require users to go to the [RAW] format, select all the lines of the script, then copy to the clipboard. By publishing them as code snippets, the website offers a [copy] button for you. With one click, the script is in your clipboard ready to paste. Attribution Attribution with these scripts is difficult, since most people just copy-paste snippets they find somewhere else, and the \"true author\" has probably been lost. For this reason, I do not claim to be the original author of every line of code. I will claim, however, to have audited and tested every script. You do not need to give me any attribution for scripts contained herein - please use them as you see fit and enjoy. If you send me a script, please include your name so I can at least give credit where it is due. Contact You can send me a private message at Xotl in the UO Outlands Discord server.

The drawback with this method is you must get at least 50 Veterinary and buy a pack horse. A lot of characters have 50 spare points in their builds, making this a viable option. In order to train healing, you will need a magical wizards hat in your pack. This is a trick to lower your own health bar temporarily so you can bandage. Most folks want to train healing alongside melee, so I have included it in this version. We can take advantage of the UO Steam diffhits capability to seldom heal the pony, while concentrating heals on your character. You will see this code below, where it prioritizes raising your healing skill and only helping the pony when its required. You can diffhits a pet, you cannot use it on another character, making it optimal for this use case. To put the proverbial cherry on top of this script, it uses your bank to pull bandages from a container. You can literally run this for days.
