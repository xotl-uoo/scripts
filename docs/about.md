Hello, my name is **Xotl**. I joined UO Outlands in December 2020 - yes, I am that new! I don't even have a house yet! Like most players new to the server, I started looking for scripts and found several github repositories forked over and over, many in a state of limbo and certainly not maintained. Being an avid fan of Ultima Online, an experienced UOSteam scripter, and a professional programmer, I decided to start my own repository.

I am a scripting *enthusiast* and, like you, always learning how to do things better. If you see anything that needs improvement or have ideas, please send them along.

### goals

I am combing through all the UOO scripting "fork and forget" github repositories available, then audit, test, publish the new versions. Since the Razor client is now supporting more commands, when possible, I will also provide Razor versions of these scripts.

After doing this for a few years, I have realized there is no script that will fit everyone 100%. Therefore, I try to provide versions that *most* people can use. Feel free to further customize to fit your needs. Much of my work is intended to teach you how to do something, and be a template for customization.

### markdown

All my my work will be in markdown, served to you as a web page. This not only provides a better user experience, but discourages the "fork and forget" behavior I have seen in github around these scripts, where people just copy a repository for their own use and not maintain it.

### attribution

Attribution with these scripts is difficult, since most people just copy-paste snippets they find somewhere else, and the "true author" has probably been lost. For this reason, I do not claim to be the original author of every line of code. I will claim, however, to have audited and tested every script. You do not need to give me any attribution for scripts contained herein - please use them as you see fit and enjoy. If you send me a script, please include your name so I can at least give credit where it is due.

### razor support

If you are using these scripts in Razor, they have been written and tested for the UOO Classic UO client only.


### contact

You can send me a private message at **Xotl** in the UO Outlands Discord server. I always appreciate requests, support, and jokes.
