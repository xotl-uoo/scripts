# Welcome to the Xotl's Script Repository

A player maintained script repository for the Ultima Online Outlands server (http://www.uooutlands.com). Now supporting both the **UOSteam** and the **CUO/Razor** clients.

## Purpose
####provide reliable, working scripts
After getting discouraged by a bunch of dead github UOSteam script repositories, I decided to create a new repository of *actively maintained* and *tested* scripts for the community. Here you will find every script has been audited and tested against the latest server code (and dates of last tests).
#### implement amazing navigation
Most script repositories are a folder full of files, which may or may not hint at what they do. I am not repeating that - its hard to find what you want. Instead, this web page has been created, with cascading menus, quick links, and easier script navigation.
####support CUO Razor
I am providing, where I can, CUO Razor versions of all scripts to use in that client.
***
Since this is a *curated* collection of scripts, there won't be many at first. I am combing through everything available for the clients, and slowly adding them. Your patience is appreciated. For those who want to peek at what I am working on, please see the [roadmap](roadmap.md).
