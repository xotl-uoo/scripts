# Welcome to the Ultima Online Outlands Script Repository

A player maintained script repository for the Ultima Online Outlands server (http://www.uooutlands.com).

This repository contains scripts for the **UOSteam** and the **CUO/Razor** clients. The primary purpose is to support the UOSteam client, since that it has the most capabilities to interact with the game. The Razor client, currently under development, lacks many of the needed features. Thus, support for CUO/Razor is a "best effort"; development is closely monitored and new scripts will be added when they provide new versions.

My preference will always be UOSteam, at least for now. So you might see 3-4 versions of a script for UOSteam, and only 1 for CUO/Razor. I am just hesitant to put a lot of time into CUO/Razor right now since its actively being developed and might change. As 2021 progresses, I expect this to slowly reverse - as it gets updated for player script needs.

Since this is a curated collection of scripts, there won't be many at first. I am combing through everything available for the clients, and slowly adding them. Since each has to be edited and tested, this is a slow process. Your patience is appreciated. For those who want to peek at what I am working on, please see the **Roadmap**.
