## Essential commands

For the Ultima Online Outlands server, I recommend reviewing and running these commands. I feel they make the game experience much better, especially if you are new. The server wiki does a poor job of documenting these and many people don't even know they exist.

All of these commands can be used in this gump:
```
[Commands
```

The commands act like a toggle, just issue them once to turn off, and again to turn on.

### New Players

Essential commands for new players. These will prevent you from flagging accidentally and save a lot of headache.

| Command      | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `[preventcriminallooting`       | Prevents opening blue corpses  |
| `[preventcriminalhealing`       | Prevents healing criminals  |


### Remove PVP Event Server Spam

I find the server spams too many PVP messages by default - like a lot. Unless you are participating in these events, turn them off. If you are not into PVP, like myself, these will de-clutter your screen:

| Command      | Suppresses                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `[showstygianriftsannouncements`       | Rifts  |
| `[showcorpsecreekcontestannouncements`       | Shrines  |
| `[showdungeonflashpointannouncements`       |  Flash Points  |
| `[showtownstruggleannouncements`       |   Town Struggles  |
